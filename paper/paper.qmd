# Introduction

Since the end of the pandemic with rising inflation, grocery prices have been a contentious topic of concern for Canadians. While grocery chains have raised prices, they also have introduced various discounts to encourage shopping. 

[insert results and scope of the study]

Understanding the results of the paper suggests when what month and grocery chains has the highest average discount for each month, allowing us to make better shopping decisions. 

The paper is structured as follows: @sec-data focuses on the data and measurement methods; @sec-results focuses on the results; @sec-discussion evaluates correlation vs causation, missing data and different sources of bias.

September highest discount

Walmart and Galleria in September

If we split each vendor have highest highest vendor - likely because of back2skool sales 

## Correlation vs Causation {#sec-discussion-correlation-and-causation}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Missing Data {#sec-discussion-missing-data}

The dataset only records data from February 28th, 2024 to November 11th, 2024. The problem is then that the February entry in *iNSERT FIGURE* does not accurately reflect the average grocery discount. For future study, I'd want to have a greater variation of our data across multiple years so we can find a more accurate the average grocery discount for each month. 

Moreover, the database had a lot of errors where either discounts were not listed, not all the entries were discounts, and the discount values were listed in text. All three errors made certain values unusable, leading us to filter them out of the dataset.
